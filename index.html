            A simple app where users can add and delete tasks. It helps manage a
            list of things to do using basic JavaScript functions. I used React
            for the frontend to create an interactive and dynamic user

            In this project, I used TheMealDB API to fetch and display a list of
            meals. Users can search for specific meals or browse through a
            selection, with each meal showing a name and image.

            This project is a Focus Matrix that helps users organize tasks into
            four categories: Urgent & Important, Not Urgent & Important, Urgent
            & Not Important, and Not Urgent & Not Important. Users can add tasks
            to each category to manage their to-do list more easily.

            Postman API Testing Project In this project, I demonstrated my
            ability to use Postman for testing APIs. I created and executed
            automated tests for various API endpoints, including GET, POST, PUT,
            and DELETE requests. By using Postman, I ensured that the APIs
            functioned correctly, returned the expected responses, and handled
            errors properly. This testing approach allowed me to verify the
            performance and reliability of backend services, showcasing my
            skills in API testing and automation.

            Cypress Web Testing Project In this project, I worked with Cypress
            to automate some basic web application tests. The tests involved
            actions like clicking, scrolling, and interacting with different
            elements on a webpage. Cypress helped me simulate user behavior to
            ensure that key features of the web application were working
            correctly. This project gave me practical experience in setting up
            simple test cases and verifying the functionality of web pages.

          <p>
            In this project, I developed an automated testing framework using
            Selenium to ensure the functionality and performance of web
            applications. The framework efficiently tests various features of
            the website, simulating user interactions such as form submissions,
            navigation, and element verification. By automating these tests, the
            project enhances reliability, reduces manual testing time, and
            ensures consistent performance across different browsers and
            platforms.

            points. The game tests speed, accuracy, and reaction time, making it
            both fun and engaging.

            This Todo App is built using Firebase for backend functionality and
            React for the frontend. It allows users to add,and delete tasks
            seamlessly in real-time, with data synchronized across devices. The
            app provides a clean and intuitive user experience, helping users
            stay organized and manage their tasks effectively.

            This project fetches and displays COVID-19 statistics for specific
            countries using a public API. Built with React, it allows users to
            input a country name and see the relevant data, such as total cases
            and deaths. Axios is used for API calls, and the data is updated in
            real-time as users search for different countries.
